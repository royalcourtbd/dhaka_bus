## 🏗️ Architecture Implementation

Both features follow the **Clean Architecture** pattern with **MVP (Model-View-Presenter)** design:

### **Directory Structure** (for each feature):

```
lib/features/[feature_name]/
├── data/
│   ├── datasource/          # Remote data source implementations
│   └── repositories/        # Repository implementations
├── domain/
│   ├── datasource/         # Data source abstractions
│   ├── entities/           # Business entities
│   ├── repositories/       # Repository abstractions
│   └── usecase/           # Business logic use cases
├── presentation/
│   ├── presenter/         # MVP Presenters with UI state management
│   ├── ui/               # Flutter UI pages
│   └── widgets/          # Reusable UI components
└── di/                   # Dependency injection setup
```
